## 2026-01-08: Verified & fixed test infrastructure

PRD items: setup 1-9 (all setup tasks verified complete)

Changes:
- Fixed vitest.setup.ts: use relative path for MSW server import, set onUnhandledRequest to "bypass"
- Fixed e2e/home.spec.ts: updated tests to match actual UI (Link vs Button, PIN on /join page)
- Updated PRD: marked all 9 setup tasks as passes: true

Key notes:
- Use `bun run test` not `bun test` (latter uses bun's native runner, not vitest)
- All 48 unit tests pass, all 6 E2E tests pass
- typecheck + lint both pass

Files changed:
- vitest.setup.ts
- e2e/home.spec.ts
- plans/prd.json
